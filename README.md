# Homecluster

![Photograph of the homecluster](./media/cluster.jpeg)

Homecluster is my homelab. I use it for learning, running fun things, and whatever I feel like. I currently run a single Raspberry Pi for Kubernetes using Talos Linux and have two older Pis running Raspbian for running various tasks. I want to gradually build towards a four node Kubernetes cluster using Talos, but I'll need to buy three more modern Pis for that.

Running a homelab is a learning experience and I want to share what I learn with everyone else. I try to [document my work](./notebook) for my future self and for others.
